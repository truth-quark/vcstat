# Version Control Status

The `vcstat` utility is designed for performing project directory wide statuses of one of more version control repositories. If you have multiple repos under development, `vcstat` provides an efficient means to perform a `status` (e.g. `git status`) across multiple directories to outline outstanding changes.
